Very much so a work in progress as I learn how to use Github pages (and actually do the project).

[Getting Setup](./getting_setup.html): Installs and file downloads

[Making A Map](./making_a_map.html): All the way from file imports to nearly complete SVG exports

[Finishing Touches](./finishing_touches.html): Putting the last bits of detail on the map

Instructions are based on this [blog post](https://theshamblog.com/making-a-laser-cut-topo-map-the-design-phase/) and have been updated to use some of the newer features of QGIS as well as hopefully reduce the workload.
